# p5play-desktop

This template is for people that want to publish their finished p5play game as a desktop app. It uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) since that's the easiest way to do it!

If you're new to p5play, check out my [Getting Started](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/Get-Started) guide.

## Should I use this template?

Before using this template, consider that there may not be any benefit to publishing your game as a desktop app. Instead, you could use GitHub pages to host your game as a website for free!

Using this template will make updating your game harder, since you'll have to publish a new version of the app every time you make a change. If you host it as a website, you can update your game instantly.

Keep in mind that users will have to download the entire app before they can play your game, but they can start playing on a website as soon as it loads.

This template is only useful if you want to make a game that can be played completely offline or if your game uses more than ~500MB of assets on load.

## Setup

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't already.

Open a terminal in this folder.

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to run the app.

Replace the contents of `app` with your game's code.

## Publishing

Remember to replace the `app-icon.png` with your own app icon!
